<p>Welcome to Quasi-Meta-Create, a Quasi-Meta-mod Quasi-Meta-offering a variety of Quasi-Meta-tools and Quasi-Meta-blocks for Quasi-Meta-Building, Quasi-Meta-Decoration, and Quasi-Meta-Aesthetic Quasi-Meta-Automation.</p>
<p>The added elements of tech are designed to leave as many Quasi-Meta-design choices to the Quasi-Meta-player as possible. With Quasi-Meta-Create, the Quasi-Meta-game isn't played inside a bunch of UIs, it challenges you to set up Quasi-Meta-contraptions of animated Quasi-Meta-components working together in many possible arrangements.</p>
<p>Quasi-Meta-Create's visual in-game documentation called 'Quasi-Meta-Ponder' will guide you through all added Quasi-Meta-mechanics and Quasi-Meta-gadgets.</p>
